This plugin provides the following widgets: attrs

=head2 C< attrs >

This method returns HTML attribute strings, so:

  $factory->attrs({
    size => 10,
    name => q(Michael "Five-Toes" O'Gambini),

None of the standard argument rewriting applies.  These are the valid
arguments:

=over

=item -tag

This may be the name of an HTML element.  If given, it will be used to look up
what attributes are boolean.

=item -bool

This may be an arrayref of attribute names to treat as boolean arguments.

the value if true, and will be omitted if false.

If both C<-tag> and C<-bool> are given, they are unioned.
